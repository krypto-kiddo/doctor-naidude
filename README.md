All blockchain development work done as assignments/projects under Blockchain training scholarship program by Dr. Obulpathi Naidu Challa

Full story:

One random day after a surprise guest session by Dr Obulpathi Naidu Challa (whom I personaly like to address as Naidude, he's one awesome guy), he mentions anyone can contact him for an internship or smth. Ofcourse, I ring him up the same evening. He says its like a scholarship program or whatever you wanna call it. You learn blockchain dev weekly, and get paid (about INR 5k he said). Well, something i definitely wouldnt refuse in my right mind. So me and about 8 other students were selected after sending our resumes to Naidude. Surprisingly one of my classmates was also there (she's got a great personality and skillset, lets call her D). And thats how the journey started, never got paid (as of now) but i also realised that he knowledge outweighed the money a lot so i didnt really mind. He later stopped the session suddenly and later reopened another batch with tons of massrecruited students. The total strength was about 180-200 at the time of writing this (16 Jan '22). But he did call me and D the evening before startind and said we should definitely be joining in. He also mentioned how this could lead us to a 40-50 LPA placement in the blockchain industry. We joined. And finally I get my first assignment, so here's a new repository! 

Geez you read it all ?  go read a good book.
