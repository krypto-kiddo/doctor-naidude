All blockchain development work done as assignments/projects under Blockchain training scholarship program by Dr. Obulpathi Naidu Challa

Full story:

One random day after a surprise guest session by Dr Obulpathi Naidu Challa (whom I personaly like to address as Naidude, he's one awesome guy), he mentions anyone can contact him for an internship or smth. Ofcourse, I ring him up the same evening. He says its like a scholarship program or whatever you wanna call it. You learn blockchain dev weekly, and get paid (about INR 5k he said). Well, something i definitely wouldnt refuse in my right mind. So me and about 8 other students were selected after sending our resumes to Naidude. Surprisingly one of my classmates was also there (she's got a great personality and skillset, lets call her P). And thats how the journey started, never got paid (as of now) but i also realised that the knowledge outweighed the money a lot so i didnt really mind. He later stopped the session suddenly and a few days later he restarted another batch with tons of massrecruited students. The total strength was about 180-200 at the time of writing this (16 Jan '22). But he did call me and P the evening before startind and said we should definitely be joining in. He also mentioned how this could lead us to a 40-50 LPA placement in the blockchain industry. We joined. And finally I get my first assignment, so here's a new repository! 

Geez you read it all ?  go read a good book.

UPDATE: 2nd Feb 2022

So Dr Naidude announced in today's session that by the end of this month he will be interviewing people and hiring 10 interns by the end of this month, Gotta fasten the learning stuff. Things.... are gonna get a little busy i guess : )
I think i'll be cutting down my working hours at college, Anyways half of the team doesn't even show up to work. That'd give me 2hrs extra. Plus once I complete the Harry Potter series (only three parts left) that'd give me like another hour extra. So that'd be three hours extra a day maybe. A little hardcore but atleast the stuff's interesting so it shouldn't bother me much, plus i always love to learn new things its just kinda fun and soothes my curiosity.
